Hello Piano,
I am struggling to understand how to create a login button on my website. Can you send me a code snippet for
me to use that shows how to have a login button?
Regards,

Our team has received a ticket from an individual who is having trouble setting up his digital access account.
When he tries to log in, he gets the message “You have successfully logged in”
But then when he opens an article he gets the message asking him to purchase a subscription.

Here is his contact information: Ryan Kanp - Enduser@anenduser.com

The Piano dashboard confirms his account, but there are no payment details.
Can you please look into Mr. Kanp’s account and help us resolve this issue?

Interesting issue. As I still did not test the whole functionality of the system, i suppost that the root of cause 1) inactive login, 2) some blockers on the users web browser.
